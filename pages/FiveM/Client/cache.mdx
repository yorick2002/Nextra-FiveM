### How to Clear FiveM Cache

<Steps>

**Step 1: Close FiveM**

Before you begin, make sure FiveM is not running. If FiveM is open, close it to avoid any issues during the cache clearing process.

**Step 2: Navigate to the FiveM Cache Folder**

The cache folder is located within the FiveM application data folder. To access it:

1. Press `Windows + R` to open the Run dialog.
2. Type `%localappdata%/fivem\FiveM.app\data` and press Enter. This will open the cache folder.
3. Delete the Cache Files

Once you’re in the cache folder, you’ll see several folders. Delete the following:

- `cache`
- `server-cache`
- `server-cache-priv`

Deleting any of the other folders will clear the downloaded game files. You can delete those, but FiveM will have to download Updates again.
