### Important Notice

If you're reading this, you've likely started your FiveM server directly from the Zip file. This is not the correct way to run your server, and it may lead to issues such as:

- No progress being saved.
- The server will prompt you to create a new one every time it's closed.

### What You Need to Do:

1. **Close the server.**
2. **Follow the proper setup guide** You can find detailed instructions [here](https://docs.yorick.gg/FiveM/Server/Windows/Create-server).

By setting up your server the correct way, youâ€™ll ensure that everything is configured properly and your progress is saved.
