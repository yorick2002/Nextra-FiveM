# Creating a FiveM server

This guide will show you exactly how to setup a FiveM server with txAdmin in under 5 minutes!

<Callout type="info">
This guide expects a certain level of understanding when it comes to computers. If you have never worked with Linux, I advise you to either learn it yourself or to stick to Windows.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
This guide is written for the Ubuntu distribution. You can still follow it if you are using another one, but some things may not exactly be the same. Google is your friend in that case!

## Prerequisites

The packages that we will be using in this guide may not automatically be installed on your system. Below I will put a few popular distro's and their command usages.

### FXServer Cfx default

<Steps>

### Creating the root folder

- Create a folder on your Linux machine with the following command: `mkdir server`, you can call this folder whatever you want, I will call it "server" for now.
- Now go to that directory using the `cd` command: `cd server`
- Once again, create a folder, this one we will call "FXServer". I also recommend to leave the name like that as it's used very often. `cd FXServer`

### Installing 

- Because we are already in the FXServer folder now, we will perform the following command, its the `wget` command in Linux which is essentially a command-line utility for downloading files from the web.
- On your PC you need to browse to [this](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/) url. Here you should find the artifact with the *highest* number. Right click this artifact and press "Copy link"
- We will be combining the `wget` command and the URL we just copied to install the artifacts to our Linux machine.
- Go back to your Linux machine, type `wget` in your terminal followed by the URL you just copied, in my case this is: [this one](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/12846-0ec3c8f9f6e715e65beca971712384d0300a553a/fx.tar.xz)
- It should look like <LinkButton text={"this"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/CMN814eSMOC7.png"}/>
- If you press Enter, you will see that your Linux machine will start installing `fx.tar.xz` to the FXServer folder.
- If performed correctly, <LinkButton text={"this"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/O46cqqtXz8hf.png"}/> should be the result.

### Checking if the artifact has been installed
- To make sure that we actually installed the artifact correctly, we run the command `ls`, which lists all files/folders in a directory. <LinkButton text={"this"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/tC5jA5CyzE0o.png"}/> should be the result.

### Extracting the tar file

- In the command line you type the following command: `tar xf fx.tar.xz`, now press Enter. This command unpacks the archived content of the tar file.
- Now you should have 2 extra items here, a folder called `alpine` and a file called `run.sh` like <LinkButton text={"this"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/DOHVjx4sBOdA.png"}/>
- Once we have verified that we have `alpine` and `run.sh`, we can safely delete `fx.tar.xz` using the following command: `rm fx.tar.xz`. If you type `ls` again, it should only show the `alpine` folder and the `run.sh` file. <LinkButton text={"see"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/VcZSj8PEArEr.png"}/>

### Starting the FXServer

- In the Linux terminal type the following: `./run.sh`
- You will now see the following: <LinkButton text={"here"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/D1M8xn9p9uTg.png"}/>

### Accessing txAdmin on the web

- For this step it is required to have the txAdmin port forwarded, by default this is `40120`.
- To acces txAdmin on the web you will need to browse to `http://ip:40120`
- If you did that, you will now see the following page: <LinkButton text={"like this"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/OV7iBh1zF7MB.png"}/>

- In the console that just opened after starting `run.sh` you will find a pin consisting of 4 digits. You need to fill these 4 digits in on the txAdmin webpage.
- Click <LinkButton text={"Link Account"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/53Zl2ctKexiN.png"}/>
- If you do not have one, create a Cfx.re account, if you have one, click <LinkButton text={"Continue"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/OejE3TvrupOI.png"}/>
- Now you should see <LinkButton text={"the following"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/vhQmHPlunx77.png"}/>, create a password, confirm it 1 more time, accept the "Creator PLA" and click "Register"

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure to write this password down somewhere!
</Callout>

- Once you are at <LinkButton text={"this page"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/luGdq58q79xn.png"}/> click "Go to the setup page!" in the top left corner.
- Click "Next"
- Make a **short** server name for txAdmin
- Click <LinkButton text={"Popular recipes"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/xhnnaKj61YqV.png"}/>
- Click <LinkButton text={"CFX Default FiveM"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/AHUi7GgnMbZk.png"}/>
- On the "Data Location" step just click "Save"
- Finally click "Go to recipe deployer"
- Click "Next"

### Cfx Portal

- Now you will need your [Cfx](https://portal.cfx.re) license key
- Click <LinkButton text={"Sign in with Cfx.re"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/eem1KggcJvyk.png"}/>
- In the navigation bar of the Portal, click <LinkButton text={"Servers"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/bIf6kkSRMVxa.png"}/>
- Click the button that says "Generate key", it should look like <LinkButton text={"this"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/vlUdojnfQovq.png"}/>
- Display name: Whatever you want, we will call it "Test Server" for now.
- It should now look like <LinkButton text={"this"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/EOx5RnUccEJx.png"}/>
- Click "Generate".
- On the "Server Registration Keys" section you will find your newly created Cfx license key. Hover over your new key and find the "copy" button under "actions" like <LinkButton text={"as shown here"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/LeAWyi3ijsVX.png"}/>
<Callout type="warning">
Do not share this key with anyone else!
</Callout>

### txAdmin

- Go back to txAdmin and paste the key, then click "Run Recipe".
- Once the recipe is done executing, click "Next".
- Scroll down and click "Save & Run Server".
- If you have forwarded the port 30120 for FXServer, you should now be able to join the server!

### txAdmin

- Go back to txAdmin and paste the key, then click "Run Recipe".
- Since we are using a framework, we are required to use a database, first follow [this](https://docs.yorick.gg/FiveM/Server/Linux/Database) guide and then continue with the current guide.
- Once the recipe is done executing, click "Next".
- Scroll down and click "Save & Run Server".
- If you have forwarded the port 30120 for FXServer, you should now be able to join the server!
