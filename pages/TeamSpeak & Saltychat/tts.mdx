### Introduction

TeamSpeak's default Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature reads out certain messages automatically, such as notifications for new messages, people joining or leaving channels, and more. While this feature can be useful for some users, others may find it disruptive. This guide will show you how to disable the default TTS in TeamSpeak.

### How to Disable Default TTS in TeamSpeak

<Steps>

**Step 1: Open TeamSpeak**

Launch TeamSpeak. You dont have to be connected to a server to change the settings, but you can do it while connected.

**Step 2: Access Settings**

Navigate to the settings menu by clicking on the **Tools** option in the top toolbar, then selecting **Options** from the dropdown menu.

**Step 3: Go to Notifications**

In the options window, find and click on the **Notifications** tab.

**Step 4: Disable Text-to-Speech**

locate the section labeled **Sound Pack:**. Here, select **Sounds deactivated** from the dropdown menu. After selecting, hit the button on the right side to save that for every sound.

**Step 5: Save Settings**

Click **OK** or **Apply** to save your changes.

**Step 6: Apply to your current Profile**

To ensure the TTS feature will be disabled, click on the **Self** option in the top toolbar, then select **Sound Pack**. In the dropdown menu, select **Sounds deactivated**. This will apply the changes to your current profile.

### Important Notes

<Callout type="info">
Disabling TTS will stop the automatic reading of messages and notifications. If you prefer to keep some alerts but stop TTS specifically for certain actions, you can adjust individual notification settings instead of turning TTS off entirely.
