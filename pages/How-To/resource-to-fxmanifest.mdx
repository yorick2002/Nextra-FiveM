# Migrating from `__resource.lua` to `fxmanifest.lua`

This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to migrate from `__resource.lua` to `fxmanifest.lua` for FiveM resources.

## Step 1: Open the `__resource.lua` file

First, locate and open your `__resource.lua` file. If you have the line below, remove it:

```lua
resource_manifest_version 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
```

## Step 2: Add `fx_version` and `game`

Next, add the following lines to specify the correct version and game type for your resource:

```lua
fx_version 'cerulean'
game 'gta5'
```

## Step 3: Rename the file

After adding the necessary lines, rename the file from `__resource.lua` to `fxmanifest.lua`.
